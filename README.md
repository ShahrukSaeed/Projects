# Projects
This is my data science project portfolio and below I have listed the projects in this portfolio along with a description of each project

1. Loan Default Prediction using Random Forest Classification 
Description: 
  -Using exploratory data analysis, Data Cleaning, and classification techniques to create a random forest classifier model to 
   predict whether an individual will default on a loan. This model achieved an accuracy of 89% and an f1 score of .729
   
2. Titanic Survival Predictions using a light Gradient Boosting Classification algorithm 
Description:
  -Using exploratory data anaylsis, Data cleaning and advanced classification techniques to create a light gbm classifier model to 
   predict whether an individual will survive on the titanic or not. This model acieved an accuracy of 82% and f1 score of .769

3. Model Parameter experimentation on imbalanced and balanaced data:
   The Project is an analysis of Neural Network, KNN, and Support Vector Machines algorithms on
     2 classification problems one using an imbalanced target class dataset and the 
     other using a balanced target class dataset. The goal is of the project is to explore different
     parameters of each model on performance and describe why a model with a specific configuration
     performs or underperforms.
